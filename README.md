# Project 6 - Tumblr API Feed

Submitted by: Ji Zhang

This simple Tumblr API Feed is an app that fetches a feed of blog posts from the Tumblr API and displays them in a scrolling list via a table view. Users can pull to refresh and view more posts alternating content from two Tumblr accounts. The posts are shuffled to display in random order.

## Notes

I was stuck at passing the caption and image data from my view controller to the detail view controller for a long time. However, I eventually was able to use Lab 6 notes to understand the structure better and resolve the difficulty I faced.
